<!-- TODO -->

Welcome to Pixles! Pixles is a powerful asset management service for all your photos, videos and media files. It is built for professionals and enthusiasts who expect high-performance, modern features, and reliability.

To get started, you need a client application and a server (either on a public instance or [self-hosted](/guides/self-hosting/)).

> Note: We currently officially support self-hosting servers but for those interested in using through some public instance, please react to <https://github.com/justin13888/Pixles/discussions/81>

TODO: Add instructions for convenient places to download clients

Note: Clients are also available on our GitHub releases page.
<!-- TODO: add link ^^ -->
