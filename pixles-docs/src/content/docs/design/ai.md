<!-- TODO: Finalize the designs described in this article -->

## System Architecture Overview

The platform utilizes an asynchronous, event-driven microservice architecture designed to handle high-throughput ingestion of RAW photos and 4K+ video.

* **API Gateway & Core Logic:** Rust (Axum/Actix-web) for maximum throughput and memory safety.
* **Source of Truth:** PostgreSQL.
* **Vector Database:** PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension for storing and querying ML embeddings.
* **Message Broker & Caching:** Valkey (Stream data structures for event queuing).
* **Object Storage:** S3-compatible store (MinIO/AWS S3) for original files and generated proxies.
* **AI Inference Workers:** Python/C++ microservices running models optimized with TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, or vLLM.

## The Complete ML Pipeline

The pipeline is split into a synchronous "Fast Path" for immediate user feedback and an asynchronous "AI Path" for deep indexing.

### Phase 1: Ingestion & Fast Path

1. **Upload:** Client pushes the media file to the Object Store and notifies the Rust API.
2. **Metadata Extraction:** Rust extracts EXIF/IPTC data (f-stop, shutter speed, camera model, GPS).
3. **Deterministic Deduplication:** Rust calculates a file hash (XXH3) and a Perceptual Hash (pHash) for photos.
4. **Proxy Generation:** Rust generates web-optimized proxies and thumbnails.
5. **Event Dispatch:** A message (e.g., `media_ready_for_ai: {media_id: uuid}`) is pushed to a Valkey Stream.

### Phase 2: AI Processing (Asynchronous)

Worker nodes consume the Valkey stream and process the media in parallel:

1. **Embedding Generation:** The image is passed through a vision encoder to create a global semantic vector.
2. **Dense Tagging & OCR:** The image is analyzed for granular objects, background elements, and text.
3. **Biometric Pipeline:** Faces are detected, aligned, cropped, and embedded. Bodies are detected and embedded for Person Re-Identification (Re-ID).
4. **Quality Assessment:** The image is scored for technical flaws (blur, noise, exposure).

### Phase 3: Storage & Indexing

1. **Vector Storage:** Embeddings are written to `pgvector` columns.
2. **Graph Linking:** Re-ID embeddings are linked to specific face profiles via database relations.

## Extended Detail: Key Algorithmic Implementations

<!-- TODO: There are details for several other algorithms that could be expanded here -->

### Video-as-Sparse-Photos Algorithm

Processing every frame of a video through heavy ML models is computationally prohibitive. This algorithm treats video as a sparse collection of keyframes.

1. **Cut Detection:** Use PySceneDetect (Content-Aware routing) to chunk the video into visually distinct scenes.
2. **Temporal Sampling:** Extract frames at the 10%, 50%, and 90% timestamps of each scene.
3. **Blur Rejection:** Calculate the variance of the Laplacian for each extracted frame: 

    $$V = \text{var}(\nabla^2 I)$$

. If $V$ is below a defined threshold, the frame is too blurry and is discarded.
4. **Audio Processing:** Run Whisper-large-v3 concurrently to generate a timestamped transcript.
5. **Integration:** The surviving keyframes are pushed into the standard image Valkey stream. Database records map the keyframe embeddings to the parent `video_id` and specific timestamp.

### The Re-ID & Pseudo-Labeling Loop

This algorithm identifies individuals even when they turn away from the camera during an event.

1. **The Anchor Pass:** When an image contains a high-confidence frontal face, run InsightFace. If the embedding matches a known profile (e.g., "Bride"), record the bounding box.
2. **The Body Pass:** Run a standard object detector (YOLOv10) to find all "person" bounding boxes. Pass these crops through OSNet to get a 512-dimensional body embedding.
3. **The Linking Phase:** Calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the Face bounding box and the Body bounding box. If $\text{IoU} > 0.7$, link the OSNet body embedding to the "Bride" profile for the duration of this specific album/event.
4. **Pseudo-Labeling:** When an image features a person facing away (no face detected), compare the OSNet body embedding against the temporary event-specific body embeddings using cosine similarity: 

    $$\text{sim}(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\|}$$

. If the similarity exceeds the threshold, tag the individual as the "Bride."

### High-Dimensional Vector Search in Postgres

To maintain high throughput in Postgres, exact K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is too slow for millions of rows.

1. Implement **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** indexes on the `pgvector` columns.
2. Use the inner product operator (`<#>`) for normalized embeddings, as it is computationally cheaper than calculating $L_2$ distance (`<->`) or cosine distance (`<=>`) at scale.
