description: How to contribute to Pixles
---

We always welcome contributions! Development typically happens across several packages, each with its own sets of toolchains. However, improvements and component-specific optimizations may only require understanding of one or very few packages. This is an important note as the number of technologies involved may seem dauntingly complicated despite the performance and reliability requirements.

This section is a work in progress although majority of information is already available on each package's README's.
