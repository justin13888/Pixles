## Who is Pixles for?

- **Photographers**: Pixles is designed for photographers who want to store and share their photos with clients and peers.
- **Families and friends**: Pixles is designed for prosumers who want to store and share their photos and videos with each other at full quality, complete with metadata.
- **Organizations**: Organizations can use Pixles to share full-quality photos and videos with their members and clients.
- **People who care about privacy**: Pixles implements the best of privacy and security practices and leaves the data in your hands.

### Who is Pixles not for?

This is a personal choice but if you're happy with existing services like Google Photos or iCloud, or sending highly compressed content over messaging apps, Pixles might not be for you.

## Some similar alternatives

- **Google Photos or similar**: Google Photos is a great service for storing and sharing photos and videos. However, it compresses and strips metadata from your photos and videos by default, and does not support many more professional or non-smartphone formats.
- **AirDrop, Quick Share or some messaging app**: These options are great for sharing photos and videos quickly, but they compress the content, have size limits, and/or do not store it for long-term access. If you have more than a few gigabytes of content, Pixles should offer a much more comfortable experience.

## Getting Started

Pixles is available on all common platforms. We expect the smoothest possible experience whether you are uploading straight from your phone or uploading from your dedicated cameras (e.g. mirrorless, GoPro, drone, cinema cameras).
