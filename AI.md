# AI Usage Policy

This project encourages the use of AI tools to enhance productivity. Our policy is simple:

1. **Personal Accountability:** You are 100% responsible for every line of code you commit. AI-generated suggestions must be treated as unverified third-party contributions.
2. **Validation:** All AI-assisted code must be manually reviewed, tested, and validated for logic, security, and architectural fit before submission.
3. **No "Vibe-Only" Commits:** Do not commit code that you do not fully understand. If you cannot explain how the AI-generated logic works, it does not belong in the codebase.

**Bottom line:** Use whatever tools you want, but personally vouch for the correctness and quality of the result.
